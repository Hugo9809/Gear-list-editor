# Task: Complete Device Library Implementation

## Status
- [ ] Verify and fix test execution
- [ ] Verify persistence of Device Library
- [ ] Ensure `DeviceList` and `DeviceEditor` are fully implemented and styled
- [ ] Verify integration with the rest of the app (e.g. can we use these devices in a project?)
- [ ] Browser verification

## Context
The Device Library components and hook exist, but tests were failing (not found) and we need to ensure "proper" implementation which implies persistence and usability.
