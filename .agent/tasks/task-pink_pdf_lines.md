# Task: Pink Lines in PDF (Pink Mode)

## Changes
- Modified `app/src/data/pdf/buildDocDefinition.js`:
  - Defined `lineColor` dynamically based on the theme.
  - Pink mode now uses `#F06292` (Pink 300) for all separator lines and table borders.
  - Other modes continue to use `#9CA3AF` (Grey 400).
- Modified `app/src/shared/utils/print.js`:
  - Updated the HTML Print fallback to also use the dynamic pink line color in CSS.

## Verification
- Added a new test case in `app/src/data/pdf/buildDocDefinition.test.js`:
  - Verifies that when `theme === 'pink'`, the generate doc definition includes the pink line hex code `#F06292` in its serialized output (specifically in canvas elements generated by notes).
- Test passed successfully.
