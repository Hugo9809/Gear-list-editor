Troubleshooting

- Command not found: Ensure Gear-list-editor is installed and in PATH. Reinstall if necessary.
- Permission denied: Check file permissions and run with appropriate privileges or adjust ownership.
- JSON parse error: Validate the input data files for syntax errors.
- Data loss concerns: Always back up data before making bulk migrations.
- Build failures: Check dependencies, toolchain versions, and environment setup.

General tips
- Run with --help for each command to confirm available options.
- Use a test data directory to avoid affecting real data during experiments.

Notes
- This document is a starter. Expand with project-specific issues and their fixes as they arise.
