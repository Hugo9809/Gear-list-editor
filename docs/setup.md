Development Setup

- Prerequisites: Ensure you have a supported runtime and tooling installed. See docs/USAGE.md for a suggested stack and commands.
- Install dependencies: Follow project-specific instructions to install dependencies (e.g., install packages, set up virtual environments). If unknown, refer to the root README for general guidance.
- Environment: Define environment variables as needed (e.g., CONFIG_PATH, DATA_DIR). Use a local .env file if supported by your runtime.
- Verification: After setup, run a quick smoke test or the project’s standard verification command as described in docs/USAGE.md.

Notes
- This setup guide is intentionally generic to accommodate multiple backends and runtimes. Replace with concrete steps once the tech stack is decided.
