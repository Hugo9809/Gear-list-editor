# Voice & Tone Guidelines

These guidelines define how Cine Power Planner (V2) should communicate with users across the UI, help text, and system messages.

## Brand Voice

* **Clear & Human:** Use plain language and short sentences.
* **Calm & Trustworthy:** Emphasize safety, reliability, and data protection.
* **Actionable:** Tell users exactly what happened and what to do next.
* **Offline-First:** Avoid messaging that implies online-only features.

## Tone Rules

* **Friendly, not casual:** Be warm and respectful without slang.
* **Direct:** Avoid unnecessary words. Prefer short, precise guidance.
* **Reassuring on Data:** When saving or restoring, acknowledge that data is protected.

## Writing Conventions

* Use sentence case for headings and labels.
* Prefer verbs for actions (e.g., “Save backup”, “Restore data”, “Import file”).
* Avoid exclamation marks unless celebrating a successful, non-critical action.

## UX Copy Examples

* **Autosave:** “All changes are saved locally.”
* **Backup created:** “Backup saved on this device.”
* **Restore complete:** “Data restored successfully. Your previous backup is still available.”
* **Error:** “We couldn’t save to one location. Your latest data is still safe in other backups.”
